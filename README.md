# > hugo-mod-icons

A Hugo Icon module that scales.

- SVG-based symbol icon system - it's 2021 and icon fonts [mostly suck](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/)
    - Wide browser compatibility
    - Re-using icons will not make your page bigger
    - Auto-enabled accessiblity by using `title` and `description` SVG symbol tags
- Icon Resolver: Intelligent and comfortable icon search function
- Currently supports Font Awesome, but aims to be icon-agnostic in future 
- Internally: Carefully implemented and structured partials, fully utilizing Hugo's power
